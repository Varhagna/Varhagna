# Hi! I'm Vahagn (Va-HAH-gun).

I'm a computer engineering and mathematics student working on a research project of developing a Machine Learning model for DNA melting temperature prediction.

My technical interests are algorithms, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, computing, computer architecture, applying mathematics to real world problems, and high performance scientific computing.  

I also really enjoy playing Minecraft and am a developer @ProjectKorra as a side hobby (which I wish I had more time to dedicate to :sob:). My last work for PK was developing an API for ability activation that ensures correctness, flexibility, and is type-agnostic.  

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, dancing, hiking, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons . I am also an aspiring aquarist.
