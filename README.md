# Hi! I'm Vahagn (Va-HAH-gun).

I'm a computer engineering and mathematics student working on a research project of developing a Machine Learning model for DNA melting temperature prediction.

My technical interests are algorithms, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, computing and computer architecture, applications of pure mathematics and scientific computing 

I also really enjoy playing Minecraft and am a developer @ProjectKorra as a side hobby (which I wish I had more time to dedicate to :sob:)

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, dancing, hiking, and reading. I am also an aspiring aquarist.
